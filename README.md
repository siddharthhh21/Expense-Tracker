# Expense-Tracker-


The Expense Tracker is a web-based application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to efficiently manage and track their daily expenses by categorizing them and summing up the total amount spent. The user can also clear all the tracked expenses with the click of a button. The total amount of expenses is displayed in Indian Rupees (₹).

Features:

Add Expenses: Users can input an expense description, select a category (Food, Transportation, Utilities, Entertainment, Others), and specify the amount of the expense. Upon submitting, the expense is added to a table displaying the description, category, and amount.

Total Expense Calculation: The app automatically calculates the total amount of all added expenses and displays it in the Indian Rupee format (₹). The total updates dynamically as new expenses are added.

Clear Expenses: A "Clear All Expenses" button is provided to remove all the listed expenses and reset the total amount back to ₹0.

Technologies Used: HTML: For structuring the webpage and form elements. CSS: For styling the user interface, making it visually appealing with form input fields, buttons, and a responsive layout. JavaScript: For functionality, including dynamically adding expenses to the table, calculating the total, and clearing all expenses.

Usage: Open the webpage, and you will see the form for entering expense details. Enter the description, choose a category, and input the amount. Click on "Add Expense" to see the expense added to the summary table, and the total will automatically update. If needed, you can click "Clear All Expenses" to reset the table and total.

Future Enhancements: Persisting data using local storage so that expenses remain even after the page is refreshed. Adding filtering options to view expenses by category. Displaying graphical summaries of the expenses for better analysis. This project demonstrates fundamental web development skills and practical implementation of DOM manipulation and event handling using JavaScript.
